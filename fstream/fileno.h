/*!\file    rrlib/util/fstream/fileno.h
 *
 * \author  Tobias Foehst
 *
 * \date    2010-07-29
 *
 * \brief   Contains an implementation of fileno for iostreams
 *
 * \b fileno
 *
 * In the POSIX world of C, all I/O operations are performed by the
 * operating system and incorporate file descriptors. While C has the
 * abstraction FILE * to be portable and usually has a suitable function
 * fileno(FILE *) that gives the user the underlying file descriptor,
 * C++ uses std::iostream and totally hides the underlying mechanisms.
 * Living in the POSIX world, obviously below the std::iostreams you will
 * find some pure file descriptors. But there is no chance to get a grip of
 * them to e.g. check if they belong to a TTY or not.
 *
 * This implementation of a template function called GetFileDescriptor is
 * meant to give access to the underlying file descriptor of a given stream
 * buffer, if it exists to allow use of further POSIX functionality. In a
 * non-POSIX context, the function returns -1 and is therefore perfectly
 * portable.
 *
 * See http://www.ginac.de/~kreckel/fileno for more information.
 *
 * \note The original code works on complete streams. For the use within
 *       this library it was altered to work directly on std::basic_streambuf.
 *
 * \note The formatting and naming in this file is not conforming to the
 *       RRLib Coding Style guidelines because it is a copy of code from
 *       public domain. That makes it easier to merge with updates from
 *       upstream.

 *
 * Similar to fileno(3), but taking a C++ streambuf as argument instead of a
 * FILE*. Note that there is no way for the library to track what you do with
 * the descriptor, so be careful.
 *
 * \param stream_buffer   The stream buffer of which the file descriptor should be determined
 *
 * \returns  The integer file descriptor associated with the streambuf, or -1 if that streambuf is invalid.
 *           In the latter case, for the sake of keeping the code as similar to fileno(3), errno is set to EBADF.
